    - title: "Backend Development"
      text: "Backend development is my bread-and-butter skill set. I've maintained and supported existing systems using Python (Django) and C++, as well as designed them from the ground up with Java and Python (FastAPI / Unicorn / Socketify). These have all used a plethora of SQL databases, been maintained with Git, and run on Linux."
    - title: "Systems Administration"
      text: "I have been interested with systems administration for about as long as I can remember. Professionally I have mostly worked with AWS, and Proxmox KVMs.  On the infra side, I have experience primarily with Cisco Meraki, Ubiquiti and some Dell systems. I have also run a very overbuilt 'home-lab' for the last 6 years, which runs just about everything I can get my hands on."
    - title: "Embedded Systems"
      text: "I got into embedded systems in high school and been hooked ever since. I have since worked all the way from designing main-board PCBs to rolling custom linux on Raspberry Pis. This includes programming FPGAs, writing baremetal C, and a veritable plethora of ESP* projects. Most recently I've worked with mesh 900mhz networks for robotics as well as Wifi for IOT devices."
    - title: "User Experience"
      text: "There's nothing I like more than a quality user experience. Since I wrote my own homescreen for my jailbroken iPhone 4s, I've had a fascination/obsession with how enjoyable it is to use a quality UI. While I've never explicitly done it professionally, I slaved over nailing the feel in just about every personal project I have to interact with."
    - title: "You tell me!"
      text: "I love a challenge and learning new things! If you like what's here but I haven't worked on what you're looking for, reach out. I'm interested in pretty much anything 'tech' related!"
